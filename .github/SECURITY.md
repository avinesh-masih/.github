## 🛡 Reporting Security Issues  

We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any issues you may find. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it **privately** to ensure responsible disclosure and timely resolution.  

### 📩 How to Report  
Please send an email to **skmasih11@gmail.com** with the subject line **"[Security Issue] - [Brief Description]"** and include the following details:  

- **🔍 Description**: A clear and concise summary of the vulnerability.  
- **⚙️ Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps or proof of concept (PoC) to replicate the issue.  
- **🎯 Impact Assessment**: Potential risks, affected components, and possible exploit scenarios.  
- **📸 Supporting Evidence**: Screenshots, logs, or other relevant materials.  

Alternatively, you can **open a security issue** on our GitHub repository with the `"Security"` label. Ensure that no sensitive details are disclosed publicly—only provide a general description, and we will follow up privately.
